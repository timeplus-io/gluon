Timeplus API SDK

![Timeplus SDK](sdk.png)

A `gluon` (/ˈɡluːɒn/) is an elementary particle that acts as the exchange particle (or gauge boson) for the strong force between quarks. It is analogous to the exchange of photons in the electromagnetic force between two charged particles.

In Timepluse architecture, `gluon` is the API sdk acting as the connection to Timeplus's ecosystems.
